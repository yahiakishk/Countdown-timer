A simple countdown timer built in Python
This program takes a user input in seconds, validates the input, and then displays the countdown in HH:MM:SS format until time runs out.

- Input validation (no letters, no zero, no negative numbers).
- Displays time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Countdown updates every second.
- Option to restart the timer after it ends.
